Task 1: Evaluate the lighting of the cat in the photograph. Determine whether the cat is illuminated well enough that its form, features, and textures are visible and distinguishable. The image should be neither so underexposed that the cat is lost in shadow nor so overexposed that it is washed out into a featureless glare. The standard is adequacy rather than artistry — the cat simply needs to be plainly visible under whatever light is present.

Task 2: Evaluate the sharpness and focus of the cat in the photograph. Determine whether the cat itself is rendered with crisp edges and resolved fine detail, such as the texture of its fur, the outline of its ears, and the definition of its eyes. The camera's focal plane must have landed on the cat rather than on the background or foreground. The image should also be free of motion blur that reduces the cat to a streak or smear rather than a clearly defined subject.

Task 3: Evaluate the freedom from noise and artifacts in the photograph. Determine whether the image is clean enough that the cat is not obscured by digital grain, speckle, compression blockiness, color banding, or smeared details. Even when lighting and focus are adequate, these technical imperfections can degrade the image to the point where the cat is no longer clearly and cleanly visible. The image should be sufficiently free of such interference that the cat remains easy to see.
