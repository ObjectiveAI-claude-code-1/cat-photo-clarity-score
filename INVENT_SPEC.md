Score the visual clarity of a single cat picture. Evaluate the technical quality of the image including its lighting, sharpness, focus, and freedom from noise, blur, or visual artifacts. An image where the cat is clearly visible — well-lit, crisp, and easy to see — should receive a high score. An image that is dark, blurry, noisy, or contains distracting artifacts should receive a low score. This evaluation focuses purely on the technical photographic quality, not on the subject matter, composition, or emotional impact.
